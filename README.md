# Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Understanding Public Opinion
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in Twitter data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics, brands, or events. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, helping businesses and researchers understand audience sentiments in real time. Data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization ensure that the text data is cleaned and ready for analysis.

Using machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and deep learning approaches such as LSTMs or transformers (BERT), the system predicts sentiments effectively. Visualizations like word clouds, sentiment distribution graphs, and trend analysis charts help interpret the results. This project has applications in brand monitoring, political analysis, crisis management, and customer feedback evaluation, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.
